Pipeline Concept
-----------------
We need to tie together many different processes that we use to prepare data for machine learning based model.
Pipeline is an object which makes things more efficient. 
It is a class available in sklearn library. 
Helps simplifying the chain of the transformation steps and the model.
We use pipeline along with GridsearchCV and RandomsearchCV.
Pipeline brings in standardisation. 

Pipeline object requires all the stages included to have a transform() function except for the last step which is an estimator.
Transform step transforms the input data and is input to next stage. 
Pipeline does not need to have predict, it only needs to have fit function at least.

Training => It applies fit and transform in every step => fit and transform, fit
Testing  => It applies only transform in every step    => transform, predict 

make_pipeline() => Here specifying name to each stage is not required => Name assigned to each stage is lowercase name of the function => For same names it assigns _1 and _2 at the end of names.
