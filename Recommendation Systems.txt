Recommendation System
-----------------------

Data Visualization tools - 

Tableau 
PowerBI => From Microsoft 
QLIK sense and QLIK view (main) 

Supervised => Time Series => Collecting data of rainfall from past 100years..Trend,Seasonality,Random 
Unsupervised => ARD (Associate Rule Discovery => Introduced in 1994)

NTD => Non Traditional Data

Recommendation System Types - 
--------------------------------

- Popularity Based
- Content Based  
- Collaborative (Suggest what other customer has bought)
- Hybrid (Content+Collaborative) 

Recommendation system needs - 
User ID, Item ID, Rating 

Content Based in Tableau - 
---------------------------
Dashboard > Action > Add Action > Filter

Collaborative Recommendation System 
---------------------------------------

Similarity Types - Jackard, Cosine, Correlation 
ML problems - Multicolinearity, overfitting, data has to be dynamic 

AZUREML works on cosine similarity

Jackard Similarity 
--------------------
Problem - Ignore the value of the rating 

Cosine Similarity
--------------------
Problem - Treats missing rate as negative 
Smaller the angle between the vectors => Similar are the vectors, orthogonal vectors are not similar 
Tensorflow => COllection of dataframes 

Utility Matrix 
Single Value Decomposition (SVD)

1) Extracting data - Webscrapping, or by api 
2) Cleaning data 
3) DTM (Document Term matrix) => Breaks the sentences into unigram (one word) => Each word is considered as column 
4) Get TF*IDF 
Distance between movies using unigrams 

Term Frequency = Count of word appears/total number of words 
Inverse document Frequency(IDF) = log(total number of documents/number of docs that mention term i)

Association Rule Discovery(ARD)
---------------------------------
If A=>B

Support, confidence, lift 
Lift => Higher the lift better it is 

Install rake-nltk package
Install scikit-surprise 

Convert the problem to user id, item id, rating
